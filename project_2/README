Instructions on how to run our system:

1. Recompile the kernel to add a new system call. The source code of the system call is in the file called “nodeadlock.c”
	Edit Makefile for the new system call:
		obj-y := nodeadlock.o
	Edit Makefile for the kernel source code: 
		core-y          := usr/ nodeadlock/
	Edit arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl: 
		318     64      nodeadlock              sys_nodeadlock
	Edit include/linux/syscalls.h:
		asmlinkage long sys_nodeadlock(const char *action, int thread_id, int index, int* retval);
	make
	make install
	reboot
2. After rebooting the newly compiled kernel, cd to the project_2 folder
3. Run the program
4. run "make lib" or "make all"
5. run "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
6. run "./bestoffer"
